DISCO:
  - In HW 48, a binary search on an array with length 10000 took such a small amount of time that the difference could sometimes not be measured using System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis());
  - 2^31 - 1 total length is the max size of an array (About 2 million)

QCC: 
  - The lengths of the arrays need to be absolutely massive if we want any data on how much time it takes to run a search
  - We could run multiple searches in a single trial so that there is a noticeable difference in time, or we could just check if the Linear run has a difference in time, as opposed to the Binary run having no difference in time
