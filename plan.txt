Experiment
  1. Create an OrderedArrayList of size 100,000
  2. Populate the OrderedArrayList with integers 0 to size- 1 using add()
  3. Search (int) (Math.random * array.length) using Linear and Binary
  4. epeat this with many different random numbers to find avg time for a random element
  5. Use currentTimeMillis() to get the milliseconds before and after each search, for both Linear and Binary
  6. Compare the LinearAvgTime to BinaryAvgTime
  7. Repeat with OrderedArrayLists of different sizes
