Experiment
  1. Create an array of size 100,000 
  2. Populate the array with integers 0 to size- 1 using add()
  3. Search for every element in the array using Linear and Binary
  4. Repeat this many different times to find avg time for an element
  5. Use currentTimeMillis() to get the milliseconds before and after each search, for both Linear and Binary
  6. Compare the LinearAvgTime to BinaryAvgTime
  7. Compare the time of the worst case scenario for Binary and Linear
  8. Repeat with arrays of different sizes

Changes to plan
  - Decided to use normal arrays instead of OrderedArrayList because OrderedArrayList was unecessary
  - Decided to search for every element in the array instead of searching for a set of random numbers
  - Included a step of measuring the worst case scenario as discussed in class
